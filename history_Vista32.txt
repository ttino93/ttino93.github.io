<<< Note >>>
The remote Wake-On-LAN function of AX88772A/AX88772 Vista driver doesn't care of 
the "Power Management" setting in the AX88772A/AX88772 Vista driver property in order to 
workaround some potential power management function issues of the earlier Vista system. 

User just needs to set the "WakeUp" parameter of AX88772A/AX88772 Vista driver 
to enable the remote Wake-On-LAN function. If you still have problems, please contact
the manufacturer of your AX88772A/AX88772 device to make sure if your AX88772A/AX88772 
board is supported the remote Wake-On-LAN capability or not.
